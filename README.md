+ **Project summary**: 

In a city of cramped living quarters, fifth-floor walk-ups and limited access to outdoor space, you may think pets would be a tough sell for New York City residents. Yet roughly 425,000 dogs live in New York City – more dogs than there are people in Oakland, CA.

To develop this project, we referenced the data on NYC Open Data, as well as other open data sources such as Google, Github and Kaggle, to uncover the most popular dog breeds and names in NYC neighborhoods, and the best neighborhoods in New York City for dogs and their faithful owners. Moreover, we included the statistical analysis of the most dog bites occurence in NYC neighborhoods for those people who want to live in the neighborhoods with fewer dogs. Our project goal is to help you get extensive dog-related information around NYC's neighborhoods.
